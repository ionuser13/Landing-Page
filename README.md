# Vet Landing Page
This is a landing page for a fake vet.
## Description
This project's goal is to build an landing page for a vet from scratch. The principal components were built in the same file from start. The technologies used were HTML CSS since it was part of the freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.
## Authors and acknowledgment
The development of this project was made by me. The design for the components were entirely provided by an example in freeCodeCamp.
